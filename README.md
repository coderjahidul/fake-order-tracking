Prevent fake orders and reduce risk in your WooCommerce store. Automatically check customer delivery success rate (DSR) and adjust payment options accordingly.

== Description ==

**WooCommerce Fake Order Tracking** protects your store from risky and fake orders by checking the customerâ€™s Delivery Success Rate (DSR) in real time.

This plugin interacts with a fraud detection API using the customerâ€™s phone number, evaluates their order history, and automatically adjusts available payment methods during checkout. For customers with a low DSR, the plugin can force advanced delivery charge payment by disabling Cash on Delivery (COD). If the customer has a good DSR, COD remains enabled.

Additionally, the plugin logs and stores DSR check results with each order and provides an admin dashboard view for reviewing DSR data per customer.

3. Go to **Settings > Fake Order Tracking** to enter your API URL and API Key.
4. The plugin will now start validating customer phone numbers during checkout and adjust payment gateways accordingly.

== Usage ==

1. When a customer enters their phone number at checkout, the plugin sends a request to the configured API to fetch their DSR.
2. If the customer has a **low success rate**, the plugin will:
   - Hide the **Cash on Delivery** option.
   - Show a **prepaid delivery method** (configured via your WooCommerce payment gateways).
3. If the customer has a **good DSR**, the **Cash on Delivery** option is shown normally.
4. The DSR result is stored with the order and can be viewed from the order edit screen in the admin panel.
